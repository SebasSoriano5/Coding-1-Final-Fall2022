                  <p class="card-text">With Argentina beating Australia they were to face Netherlands. The match began to heat up before it started as the manger from Netherlands had started to talk a lot of trash towards Messi and Argentina and were saying that the match would be easy as they found a way to stop Messi in his tracks. This however was not the case and Messi was playing the ball around the Netherland's defense. With an early goal from Nahuel Molina the game had only gotten more intense. Messi scored another penalty kick and later the game was tied leading them into a penalty shootout to see who would advance. Messi took the first shot to set the mood and the rest was easy for Argentina's squad as they cleaned up the rest.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">The greatest player of all time was now forced to face the greatest midfielder of all time and the battle was not easy. Argentina has a good rivalry with Croatia as they are on and off with wins. This match was intese both teams fighting to the end for the chance to be at the final. Sadly for Croatia an early penalty kick from Messi had brought Croatian players morality down. This set the stage for a second goal five minutes after Messi scored. This showed that the Argentinan national team was to advance to the final.</p>
